# myPhysicsEngine
2D physics engine

I used the Java programming language to create my own Physics Engine, which is a software package which's aim is to simulate the motion of real-world physical objects in a virtual environment where all variables can be controlled. 

Though unfinished, my completed progress on the project allows for visual confirmation of the simulation of accelerated motion and elastic collisions of 2D rigid bodies.

As a personal project, this was originally intended as an application of what I had learned test my understanding of kinematics and motion, from what I had gained from an early course in Physics. Much consideration was given to the Software Design and ease-of-use of the API, as I also had in mind for this project to be open-sourced, and perhaps be of use as a teaching tool.
